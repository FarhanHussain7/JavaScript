Here’s a detailed list of MERN stack interview questions with concise, high-impact answers to help you ace your mechanical round.

🧠 JavaScript & ES6+
- Q: What is the difference between var, let, and const?
A: var is function-scoped and allows redeclaration. let and const are block-scoped; const cannot be reassigned.
- Q: What is a closure?
A: A closure is a function that retains access to its lexical scope even when executed outside that scope.
- Q: Explain the event loop.
A: The event loop handles asynchronous operations by placing callbacks in a queue and executing them after the call stack is clear.

🗂️ MongoDB
- Q: How do you model one-to-many relationships?
A: Use embedded documents for small datasets or references (ObjectId) for scalable relationships.
- Q: What are indexes in MongoDB?
A: Indexes improve query performance by allowing MongoDB to quickly locate data without scanning every document.
- Q: What is aggregation?
A: Aggregation processes data records and returns computed results using stages like $match, $group, $sort.

🔌 Express.js
- Q: What is middleware in Express?
A: Middleware functions run during the request-response cycle and can modify req, res, or end the cycle.
- Q: Difference between app.use() and app.get()?
A: app.use() applies middleware to all routes; app.get() handles GET requests for a specific path.
- Q: How do you handle errors globally?
A: Use a custom error-handling middleware with four parameters: (err, req, res, next).

⚛️ React.js
- Q: What is the virtual DOM?
A: A lightweight copy of the real DOM that React uses to optimize rendering by diffing and updating only changed elements.
- Q: What is prop drilling?
A: Passing props through multiple levels of components. Avoid it using Context API or state management tools like Redux.
- Q: How does useEffect work?
A: It runs side effects after render. You can control its execution with dependency arrays.

🌐 Node.js
- Q: What is the role of the event loop in Node.js?
A: It enables non-blocking I/O by handling asynchronous callbacks in a single-threaded environment.
- Q: What are streams?
A: Streams handle continuous data flow (e.g., file read/write) efficiently using Readable, Writable, Duplex, and Transform.
- Q: How do you manage environment variables?
A: Use .env files and the dotenv package to load variables into process.env.

🔄 Full-Stack Integration
- Q: How do you handle CORS?
A: Use the cors middleware in Express to allow cross-origin requests from the frontend.
- Q: How do you implement JWT authentication?
A: Generate tokens on login, store them in localStorage or cookies, and verify them in protected routes using middleware.
- Q: How do you deploy a MERN app?
A: Use services like Vercel (frontend), Heroku or Render (backend), and MongoDB Atlas for cloud database.

🧪 Testing & Debugging
- Q: How do you test React components?
A: Use tools like Jest and React Testing Library to simulate user interactions and assert UI behavior.
- Q: How do you test Express APIs?
A: Use Postman for manual testing and Jest/Supertest for automated endpoint testing.

🛡️ Best Practices
- Q: How do you secure a MERN app?
A: Use HTTPS, sanitize inputs, validate data, implement rate limiting, and use secure headers (helmet middleware).
- Q: What are CI/CD tools you’ve used?
A: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI for automated testing and deployment pipelines.
